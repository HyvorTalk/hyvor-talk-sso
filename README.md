## Hyvor Talk Single Sign-on

This repository includes several scripts in different languages on how to generate hashes to implement single sign-on with [Hyvor Talk](https://talk.hyvor.com).

To learn how Single Sign-on works, please see this tutorial.
https://talk.hyvor.com/documentation/sso/set-up

In that tutorial, the back-end code is explained with PHP. If you need an alternative, please check this repository.

* PHP - `sso.php`
* Ruby - `sso.rb`
* Javascript (NodeJS)  - `sso.js`

We'll eventually add more languages.
